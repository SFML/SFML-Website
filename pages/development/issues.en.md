# Issues

## You have no idea what causes your issue

1. Create a [minimal and complete code example](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5559.msg36368#msg36368) which reproduces the issue.
2. If while reducing your codebase the issue hasn't revealed itself to you:
    - Have a look at the [Frequently Asked Questions](../faq/index.md).
    - Go through the [official tutorials](../tutorials/3.0/index.md) again, and make sure to read and understand the text in red boxes.
    - [Search the forum](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?action=search) for similar issues.
    - If and only if none of the above has helped you resolve your issue: Create a new thread on the forum and make sure to follow the [forum rules](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5559.0).

## You think you found a bug in SFML

1. Make sure it is really a bug and not a misunderstanding of what SFML is supposed to do. Check the [documentation](../documentation/3.0.0/index.html) again to be sure.
2. Make sure the bug has not already been reported. Check [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues) and [the forum](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?action=search).
3. Use the [latest revision](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) from GitHub and check if the bug has not already been fixed. Refer to the [official tutorial](../tutorials/3.0/getting-started/cmake.md) for information on how to build SFML yourself.
4. Open a new thread on the [forum](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/) in the appropriate help board and give the following information:
    - [A minimal and complete code example](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5559.msg36368#msg36368) that reproduces the bug as you are experiencing it.
    - Instructions for reproducing the bug if it isn't obvious when running the example.
    - Environment information (operating system, SFML version, compiler, etc.).
    - Screenshots and/or videos, if necessary, to demonstrate certain behavior.
    - Anything else that helps identify the problem.
