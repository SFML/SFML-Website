# Donate

SFML is operated by a handful of volunteers who invest their free time into maintaining the library, website and community resources.
On top of that we're fortunate enough to have a vibrant SFML community, with lots of people providing fixes, features, and ensuring a high quality.

With the use of Open Collective Europe as Fiscal Host we want to offer a transparent way to financially support SFML either through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/SFML) or directly on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/sfml).
Every contribution and expense is listed publicly on Open Collective.

The collected money will be used to cover running costs (e.g. hosting, email, software license, etc.) and potentially invested in hardware (e.g. Mac Mini, Raspberry Pi, game controller, etc.) to support the development of SFML.
