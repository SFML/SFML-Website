<h1>Designing your own entities with vertex arrays</h1>

<?php h2('Introduction') ?>
<p>
    SFML provides simple classes for the most common 2D entities. And while more complex entities can easily be created from these building blocks, it isn't always the
    most efficient solution. For example, you'll reach the limits of your graphics card very quickly if you draw a large number of sprites. The reason is that performance
    depends in large part on the number of calls to the <code>draw</code> function. Indeed, each call involves setting a set of OpenGL states, resetting matrices, changing textures, etc.
    All of this is required even when simply drawing two triangles (a sprite). This is far from optimal for your graphics card: Today's GPUs are designed to process large batches of
    triangles, typically several thousand to millions.
</p>
<p>
    To fill this gap, SFML provides a lower-level mechanism to draw things: Vertex arrays. As a matter of fact, vertex arrays are used internally by all other SFML classes. They allow
    for a more flexible definition of 2D entities, containing as many triangles as you need. They even allow drawing points or lines.
</p>

<?php h2('What is a vertex, and why are they always in arrays?') ?>
<p>
    A vertex is the smallest graphical entity that you can manipulate. In short, it is a graphical point: Naturally, it has a 2D position (x, y), but also a color, and
    a pair of texture coordinates. We'll go into the roles of these attributes later.
</p>
<p>
    Vertices (plural of vertex) alone don't do much. They are always grouped into <em>primitives</em>: Points (1 vertex), lines (2 vertices), triangles (3 vertices) or quads (4 vertices).
    You can then combine multiple primitives together to create the final geometry of the entity.
</p>
<p>
    Now you understand why we always talk about vertex arrays, and not vertices alone.
</p>

<?php h2('A simple vertex array') ?>
<p>
    Let's have a look at the <?php class_link('Vertex') ?> class now. It's simply a container which contains three public members and no functions besides its constructors.
    These constructors allow you to construct vertices from the set of attributes you care about -- you don't always need to color or texture your entity.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">// create a new vertex
sf::Vertex vertex;

// set its position
vertex.position = sf::Vector2f(10, 50);

// set its color
vertex.color = sf::Color::Red;

// set its texture coordinates
vertex.texCoords = sf::Vector2f(100, 100);
</code></pre>
<p>
    ... or, using the correct constructor:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::Vertex vertex(sf::Vector2f(10, 50), sf::Color::Red, sf::Vector2f(100, 100));
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now, let's define a primitive. Remember, a primitive consists of several vertices, therefore we need a vertex array. SFML provides a simple wrapper for this:
    <?php class_link('VertexArray') ?>. It provides the semantics of an array (similar to <code>std::vector</code>), and also stores the type of primitive its vertices define.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">// create an array of 3 vertices that define a triangle primitive
sf::VertexArray triangle(sf::Triangles, 3);

// define the position of the triangle's points
triangle[0].position = sf::Vector2f(10, 10);
triangle[1].position = sf::Vector2f(100, 10);
triangle[2].position = sf::Vector2f(100, 100);

// define the color of the triangle's points
triangle[0].color = sf::Color::Red;
triangle[1].color = sf::Color::Blue;
triangle[2].color = sf::Color::Green;

// no texture coordinates here, we'll see that later
</code></pre>
<p>
    Your triangle is ready and you can now draw it. Drawing a vertex array can be done similar to drawing any other SFML entity, by using the <code>draw</code> function:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">window.draw(triangle);
</code></pre>
<img class="screenshot" src="./images/graphics-vertex-array-triangle.png" alt="A triangle made with vertices"/>
<p>
    You can see that the vertices' color is interpolated to fill the primitive. This is a nice way of creating gradients.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you don't have to use the <?php class_link('VertexArray') ?> class. It's just defined for convenience, it's nothing more than a
    <code>std::vector&lt;sf::Vertex&gt;</code> along with a <code>sf::PrimitiveType</code>. If you need more flexibility, or a static array, you can use your own
    storage. You must then use the overload of the <code>draw</code> function which takes a pointer to the vertices, the vertex count and the primitive type.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">std::vector&lt;sf::Vertex&gt; vertices;
vertices.push_back(sf::Vertex(...));
...

window.draw(&amp;vertices[0], vertices.size(), sf::Triangles);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::Vertex vertices[2] =
{
    sf::Vertex(...),
    sf::Vertex(...)
};

window.draw(vertices, 2, sf::Lines);
</code></pre>

<?php h2('Primitive types') ?>
<p>
    Let's pause for a while and see what kind of primitives you can create. As explained above, you can define the most basic 2D primitives: Point, line, triangle
    and quad (quad exists merely as a convenience, internally the graphics card breaks it into two triangles). There are also "chained" variants of these primitive types
    which allow for sharing of vertices among two consecutive primitives. This can be useful because consecutive primitives are often connected in some way.
</p>
<p>
    Let's have a look at the full list:

<?php h2('Texturing') ?>
<p>
    Like other SFML entities, vertex arrays can also be textured. To do so, you'll need to manipulate the <code>texCoords</code> attribute of the vertices. This attribute defines
    which pixel of the texture is mapped to the vertex.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">// create a quad
sf::VertexArray quad(sf::Quads, 4);

// define it as a rectangle, located at (10, 10) and with size 100x100
quad[0].position = sf::Vector2f(10, 10);
quad[1].position = sf::Vector2f(110, 10);
quad[2].position = sf::Vector2f(110, 110);
quad[3].position = sf::Vector2f(10, 110);

// define its texture area to be a 25x50 rectangle starting at (0, 0)
quad[0].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(0, 0);
quad[1].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(25, 0);
quad[2].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(25, 50);
quad[3].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(0, 50);
</code></pre>
<p class="important">
    Texture coordinates are defined in <em>pixels</em> (just like the <code>textureRect</code> of sprites and shapes). They are <em>not</em> normalized (between 0 and 1), as
    people who are used to OpenGL programming might expect.
</p>
<p>
    Vertex arrays are low-level entities, they only deal with geometry and do not store additional attributes like a texture. To draw a vertex array with a texture,
    you must pass it directly to the <code>draw</code> function:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::VertexArray vertices;
sf::Texture texture;

...

window.draw(vertices, &amp;texture);
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is the short version, if you need to pass other render states (like a blend mode or a transform), you can use the explicit version which takes a
    <?php class_link('RenderStates') ?> object:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::VertexArray vertices;
sf::Texture texture;

...

sf::RenderStates states;
states.texture = &amp;texture;

window.draw(vertices, states);
</code></pre>

<?php h2('Transforming a vertex array') ?>
<p>
    Transforming is similar to texturing. The transform is not stored in the vertex array, you must pass it to the <code>draw</code> function.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::VertexArray vertices;
sf::Transform transform;

...

window.draw(vertices, transform);
</code></pre>
<p>
    Or, if you need to pass other render states:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">sf::VertexArray vertices;
sf::Transform transform;

...

sf::RenderStates states;
states.transform = transform;

window.draw(vertices, states);
</code></pre>
<p>
    To know more about transformations and the <?php class_link('Transform') ?> class, you can read the tutorial on
    <a href="graphics-transform.php" title="Transforming entities tutorial">transforming entities</a>.
</p>

<?php h2('Creating an SFML-like entity') ?>
<p>
    Now that you know how to define your own textured/colored/transformed entity, wouldn't it be nice to wrap it in an SFML-style class? Fortunately, SFML makes this easy for you by providing
    the <?php class_link('Drawable') ?> and <?php class_link('Transformable') ?> base classes. These two classes are the base of the built-in SFML entities
    <?php class_link('Sprite') ?>, <?php class_link('Text') ?> and <?php class_link('Shape') ?>.
</p>
<p>
    <?php class_link('Drawable') ?> is an interface: It declares a single pure virtual function and has no members nor concrete functions. Inheriting from <?php class_link('Drawable') ?>
    allows you to draw instances of your class the same way as SFML classes:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">class MyEntity : public sf::Drawable
{
private:

    virtual void draw(sf::RenderTarget&amp; target, sf::RenderStates states) const;
};

MyEntity entity;
window.draw(entity); // internally calls entity.draw
</code></pre>
<p>
    Note that doing this is not mandatory, you could also just have a similar <code>draw</code> function in your class and simply call it with <code>entity.draw(window)</code>.
    But the other way, with <?php class_link('Drawable') ?> as a base class, is nicer and more consistent. This also means that if you plan on storing an array of drawable objects,
    you can do it without any additional effort since all drawable objects (SFML's and yours) derive from the same class.
</p>
<p>
    The other base class, <?php class_link('Transformable') ?>, has no virtual function. Inheriting from it automatically adds the same transformation
    functions to your class as other SFML classes (<code>setPosition</code>, <code>setRotation</code>, <code>move</code>, <code>scale</code>, ...). You can learn more about this
    class in the tutorial on <a href="graphics-transform.php" title="Transforming entities tutorial">transforming entities</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Using these two base classes and a vertex array (in this example we'll also add a texture), here is what a typical SFML-like graphical class would look like:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">class MyEntity : public sf::Drawable, public sf::Transformable
{
public:

    // add functions to play with the entity's geometry / colors / texturing...

private:

    virtual void draw(sf::RenderTarget&amp; target, sf::RenderStates states) const
    {
        // apply the entity's transform -- combine it with the one that was passed by the caller
        states.transform *= getTransform(); // getTransform() is defined by sf::Transformable

        // apply the texture
        states.texture = &amp;m_texture;

        // you may also override states.shader or states.blendMode if you want

        // draw the vertex array
        target.draw(m_vertices, states);
    }

    sf::VertexArray m_vertices;
    sf::Texture m_texture;
};
</code></pre>
<p>
    You can then use this class as if it were a built-in SFML class:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">MyEntity entity;

// you can transform it
entity.setPosition(10, 50);
entity.setRotation(45);

// you can draw it
window.draw(entity);
</code></pre>

<?php h2('Example: tile map') ?>
<p>
    With what we've seen above, let's create a class that encapsulates a tile map. The whole map will be contained in a single vertex array, therefore it will be
    super fast to draw. Note that we can apply this strategy only if the whole tile set can fit into a single texture. Otherwise, we would have to use at least
    one vertex array per texture.
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">class TileMap : public sf::Drawable, public sf::Transformable
{
public:

    bool load(const std::string&amp; tileset, sf::Vector2u tileSize, const int* tiles, unsigned int width, unsigned int height)
    {
        // load the tileset texture
        if (!m_tileset.loadFromFile(tileset))
            return false;

        // resize the vertex array to fit the level size
        m_vertices.setPrimitiveType(sf::Quads);
        m_vertices.resize(width * height * 4);

        // populate the vertex array, with one quad per tile
        for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; width; ++i)
            for (unsigned int j = 0; j &lt; height; ++j)
            {
                // get the current tile number
                int tileNumber = tiles[i + j * width];

                // find its position in the tileset texture
                int tu = tileNumber % (m_tileset.getSize().x / tileSize.x);
                int tv = tileNumber / (m_tileset.getSize().x / tileSize.x);

                // get a pointer to the current tile's quad
                sf::Vertex* quad = &amp;m_vertices[(i + j * width) * 4];

                // define its 4 corners
                quad[0].position = sf::Vector2f(i * tileSize.x, j * tileSize.y);
                quad[1].position = sf::Vector2f((i + 1) * tileSize.x, j * tileSize.y);
                quad[2].position = sf::Vector2f((i + 1) * tileSize.x, (j + 1) * tileSize.y);
                quad[3].position = sf::Vector2f(i * tileSize.x, (j + 1) * tileSize.y);

                // define its 4 texture coordinates
                quad[0].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(tu * tileSize.x, tv * tileSize.y);
                quad[1].texCoords = sf::Vector2f((tu + 1) * tileSize.x, tv * tileSize.y);
                quad[2].texCoords = sf::Vector2f((tu + 1) * tileSize.x, (tv + 1) * tileSize.y);
                quad[3].texCoords = sf::Vector2f(tu * tileSize.x, (tv + 1) * tileSize.y);
            }

        return true;
    }

private:

    And a little demo that uses it:

<pre><code class="cpp">int main()
{
    // create the window
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(512, 256), "Particles");

    // create the particle system
    ParticleSystem particles(1000);

    // create a clock to track the elapsed time
    sf::Clock clock;

    // run the main loop
    while (window.isOpen())

        sf::Event event;

        {
            if(event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();
        }

        // make the particle system emitter follow the mouse
        sf::Vector2i mouse = sf::Mouse::getPosition(window);
        particles.setEmitter(window.mapPixelToCoords(mouse));

        // update it
        sf::Time elapsed = clock.restart();

        // draw it
        window.clear();
        window.draw(particles);
        window.display();
    }

    return 0;
